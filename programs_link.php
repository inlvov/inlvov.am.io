<h4> Gender Based Violence </h4>

<p>
We continue to scale up programs that create GBV awareness for both men and women through development and dissemination of GBV key messages. Statistically, child brides have a higher risk of becoming victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse and even murder. We raise awareness about the dangers of early child marriage & also support to young mothers to regain their well-being.
